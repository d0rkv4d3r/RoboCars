# RoboCars
29Bit CANBus at 1/10th scale.

See the included Build Your Own RoboCar.PDF file for details.  

The RoboCar MK II Src file needs to be isntalled on the Hero Development board.  Details are availble from Cross The Road (CTR) Electronics.

Of course I immediatly thought of things I left out.  Two useful things that I probably didn't mention in the build doc:
1. USB A to A cable for Hero Programming, these are actually pretty hard to find.  CTR has them
2. a USB Game controller, to manually drive the car via the Hero and test out your servo and motor functions.  I use the Logitech Gamepad F310

I'll get this updated sometime, not today.
